        Parker. In the recording
        studio, Parker writes, records, performs, and produces all of the project's music.Parker originally conceived
        the project in Perth in 2007. Originally signed to Modular Recordings, Tame Impala is now

        Impala's debut studio
        album, Innerspeaker, was released in 2010; it was certified gold in Australia and well received by critics.
        Parker's
        2012 follow-up, Lonerism, was also acclaimed, reaching platinum status in Australia and receiving a Grammy Award
        nomination for Best Alternative Music Album.Tame Impala's third album, Currents, was released in July 2015,

        <h1>CURRENTS</h1>
        Currents is the third studio album by Australian musical project Tame Impala. It
        was released on 17 July 2015 by Modular
        Recordings and Universal Music Australia. In the United States it was released by Interscope Records and
        Fiction
        Records
        in the UK, while Caroline International released it in other regions. Like the project's previous two
        albums,
        Currents
        was written, recorded, performed, and produced by Kevin Parker. For the first time, Parker mixed the music
        and
        recorded
        all instruments by himself; the album featured no other collaborators.

        After the release of his previous album, Lonerism (2012), Parker began work on Currents, largely recording
        at
        his home
        studio in Fremantle. He engrossed himself with writing and recording, and in keeping with his reputation as
        a
        musical
        auteur, laboured over the details of each song, ultimately causing the release date to be delayed by two
        months.
